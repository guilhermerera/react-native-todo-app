### üöÄ React Native Ignite 2022 - Chalange 01: ToDo App

##### This project was created as a requirement to complete the first module of the bootcamp. I was given a [documentation](https://efficient-sloth-d85.notion.site/Desafio-01-Praticando-os-conceitos-do-React-Native-f8f164e29df74cd987e1f9aebf142ffb) and a [design](https://www.figma.com/file/1XfZQGSWk4HWjvwcjd2nOP/ToDo-List) and based on those I had to developt the app from scratch.

### üîé Live View

- You can download and run the code. Use `npm install` or `yarn` to install all dependencies. After that, `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the development server. You cand choose to view the app using Expo on your device or using emulators.

### üéØ Project Goal

The goal was to implement concepts learned on the bootcamp's first module, get used to mobile development thinking and to learn how to give proper feedback on mobile, tracing paralels with web development which is where I came frome.
